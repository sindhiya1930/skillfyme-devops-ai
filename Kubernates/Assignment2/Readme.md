# Assignment #2: Deploying a Multi-Tier Application on Kubernetes

## Problem Statement
Modern applications are often composed of multiple interacting components, such as a frontend, a backend API, and a database. Deploying and managing these multi-tier applications effectively in a scalable and reliable manner is a key challenge in cloud-native environments. This assignment focuses on demonstrating the deployment of such an application on Kubernetes, addressing external accessibility, secure internal communication between tiers, and reliable data persistence for the database component.
